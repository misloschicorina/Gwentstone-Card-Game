GWENTSTONE LITE - CARD GAME

* OVERVIEW:
  * This project implements a turn-based card game inspired by Hearthstone
   and Gwent, where two players battle to reduce the opposing hero's health 
   to zero. Players place cards, attack opponents, and use special abilities
   while following specific rules to ensure strategic and balanced gameplay.

  * The game features unique rules for Minions, Heroes, and Special cards,
  all interacting on a 4x5 game board. Gameplay balances attack, defense,
  and abilities, with input generated by AI for diverse scenarios.
